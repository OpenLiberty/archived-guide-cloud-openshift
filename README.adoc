// Introduction
// =================================================================================================

== What you'll learn 

You will learn how to deploy two microservices in Open Liberty containers to an OpenShift cluster.

There are different cloud-based solutions for running your {kube} workloads. 
With a cloud-based infrastructure, you can focus on developing your microservices without worrying about low-level infrastructure details for deployment. 
Using a cloud helps you to easily scale and manage your microservices in a high-availability setup.

{kube} is an open source container orchestrator that automates many tasks that are involved in deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications. 
If you would like to learn more about Kubernetes, check out the https://openliberty.io/guides/kubernetes-intro.html[Deploying microservices to Kubernetes^] guide.

OpenShift is a Kubernetes-based platform with added functions. It streamlines the DevOps process by providing an intuitive development pipeline. 
It also provides integration with multiple tools to make the deployment and management of cloud applications easier.
To learn more about the different platforms that Red Hat OpenShift offers, check out their https://docs.openshift.com[official documentation^]. 

The two microservices you will deploy are called `system` and `inventory`. 
The `system` microservice returns the JVM system properties of the running container. 
It also returns the podâ€™s name in the HTTP header, making replicas easy to distinguish 
from each other. The `inventory` microservice adds the properties from the `system` microservice 
to the inventory. This process demonstrates how communication can be established between pods inside a cluster.

// =================================================================================================
// Prerequisites
// =================================================================================================

== Additional prerequisites

Before you can deploy your microservices, you must gain access to a cluster on OpenShift and have an OpenShift client installed. 

There are various OpenShift offerings. You can use the https://learn.openshift.com/playgrounds/openshift44[online playground^], which provides
free access to an OpenShift cluster for 60 minutes, gain access to an OpenShift cluster hosted on
https://www.openshift.com/products/openshift-ibm-cloud[IBM cloud^], or check out their other offerings
https://www.openshift.com/products[here^]. Once you have access to a cluster, make sure you are logged in to the cluster
as a cluster administrator before proceeding with the guide.
Ensure you are logged in by running the following command:

[role='command']
```
oc version
```

You should see output similar to the following:

[role='no_copy']
```
Client Version: 4.3.13
Server Version: 4.3.13
Kubernetes Version: v1.16.2
```

Before you install any resources, you need a project on your OpenShift cluster. 
Create a project named `guide` by running the following command:

[role='command']
```
oc new-project guide
```

Ensure that you are working within the project `guide` by running the following command:

[role='command']
```
oc projects
```

You should see an asterisk (*) beside the project `guide`. 

As of Openshift 4, the Docker daemon and client are no longer supported. 
This guide uses Podman as a container engine instead. 
Podman is able to use images from Docker and create its own images. 
Your cluster must have Podman installed to build the images.
Ensure you have Podman installed by running the following command:

[role='command']
```
podman --version
```

// =================================================================================================
// Getting Started
// =================================================================================================

== Getting started

The fastest way to work through this guide is to clone the https://github.com/openliberty/guide-{projectid}.git[Git repository^]
into your cluster and use the projects that are provided inside:

[source, role="command", subs="attributes"]
----
git clone https://github.com/openliberty/guide-{projectid}.git
cd guide-{projectid}
----

The `start` directory contains the starting project that you will build upon.

The `finish` directory contains the finished project that you will build.

// no "try what you'll build" section in this guide since it would be too long due to all setup the user will have to do.

// =================================================================================================
// Accessing an OpenShift cluster
// =================================================================================================

== Accessing an OpenShift cluster

Before you can deploy your microservices, you must gain access to a cluster on OpenShift.

Creating an OpenShift account automatically grants you access to their multi-tenant, OpenShift cluster. 
After you have access, you are also given access to their online web console. To login to OpenShift by using the CLI, 
navigate to the online web console by following the `[username] > Copy Login Command > Display Token > Log in with this token` path.

The command looks like the following example:

[role="no_copy"]
----
oc login --token=[your-token] --server=https://api.[region].online-starter.openshift.com:[port]
----

Create a project by running the following command:

[role=command]
```
oc new-project [project-name]
```

== Deploying microservices to OpenShift

In this section, you will learn how to deploy two microservices in Open Liberty containers to a {kube}
cluster on OpenShift. You will build and containerize the `system` and `inventory` microservices, 
push them to a container registry, and then deploy them to your {kube} cluster. 

// =================================================================================================
// Building and containerizing the microservices
// =================================================================================================

=== Building and containerizing the microservices

The first step of deploying to {kube} is to build your microservices and containerize them.

The starting Java project, which is located in the start directory, is a multi-module Maven project. 
It is made up of the `system` and `inventory` microservices. Each microservice resides in its own directory,
`start/system` or `start/inventory`. Both of these directories contain a Dockerfile, which is used by `podman` to build the container images. 
See the https://openliberty.io/guides/containerize.html[Containerizing microservices^] guide if you're unfamiliar with Dockerfiles.

To build these microservices, navigate to the `start` directory and run the following command:

[role=command]
```
mvn package
```

Run the following command to download or update to the latest `openliberty/open-liberty:kernel-java8-openj9-ubi` Docker image:

[role='command']
```
podman pull openliberty/open-liberty:kernel-java8-openj9-ubi
```

Next, run the `podman build` commands to build container images for your application:

[role='command']
```
podman build -t system:1.0-SNAPSHOT system/.
podman build -t inventory:1.0-SNAPSHOT inventory/.
```

The `-t` flag in the `podman build` command allows the image to be labeled (tagged) in the `name[:tag]` format. 
The tag for an image describes the specific image version. If the optional `[:tag]` tag is not specified, the `latest` tag is created by default.

During the build, you see various messages that describe what images are being downloaded and
built. When the build finishes, run the following command to list all local images:

[role=command]
```
podman images
```

Verify that the `system:1.0-SNAPSHOT` and `inventory:1.0-SNAPSHOT` images are listed among them, for example:

[role="no_copy"]
----
REPOSITORY                           TAG
localhost/inventory                  1.0-SNAPSHOT
localhost/system                     1.0-SNAPSHOT
docker.io/openliberty/open-liberty   kernel-java8-openj9-ubi
----

If you don't see the `system:1.0-SNAPSHOT` and `inventory:1.0-SNAPSHOT` images, check the Maven
build log for any potential errors.

// =================================================================================================
// Pushing the images to OpenShift's internal registry
// =================================================================================================

=== Pushing the images to OpenShift's internal registry

In order to run the microservices on the cluster, you need to push the microservice images into a container image registry. 
You will use OpenShift's integrated container image registry called OpenShift Container Registry (OCR). 
After your images are pushed into the registry, you can use them in the pods you create later in the guide.

First you must expose the registry using the default route by running the following command to set `defaultRoute` to `True`:

[role=command]
```
oc patch configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io/cluster --patch '{"spec":{"defaultRoute":true}}' --type=merge
```

You can then log in to registry using the following command:

[role=command]
```
podman login -u $(oc whoami) -p $(oc whoami -t) --tls-verify=false $(oc registry info)
```

The command authenticates your credentials against the internal registry so that you are able to push and pull images. 
The registry address will be displayed after you run the `podman login` command. 
It is formatted similar to the following output:

[role="no_copy"]
----
default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps.[region].[domain]
----

You can also view the registry address by running the following command:

[role=command]
```
oc registry info
```

Ensure that you are logged in to OpenShift and the registry, and run the following commands to tag your applications:

[role=command]
```
podman tag system:1.0-SNAPSHOT $(oc registry info)/$(oc project -q)/system:1.0-SNAPSHOT
podman tag inventory:1.0-SNAPSHOT $(oc registry info)/$(oc project -q)/inventory:1.0-SNAPSHOT
```

Finally, push your images to the registry:

[role=command]
```
podman push --tls-verify=false $(oc registry info)/$(oc project -q)/system:1.0-SNAPSHOT
podman push --tls-verify=false $(oc registry info)/$(oc project -q)/inventory:1.0-SNAPSHOT
```

After you push the images, run the following command to list the images that you pushed to the internal OCR:
[role=command]
```
oc get imagestream
```

Verify that the `system` and `inventory` images are listed among them, for example:
[role="no_copy"]
----
NAME        IMAGE REPOSITORY                                                                                     TAGS           UPDATED
inventory   default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps.us-west-1.starter.openshift-online.com/guide/inventory   1.0-SNAPSHOT   3 seconds ago
system      default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps.us-west-1.starter.openshift-online.com/guide/system      1.0-SNAPSHOT   17 seconds ago
----

// Deploying the microservices
// =================================================================================================

=== Deploying the microservices

Now that your container images are built, deploy them by using a Kubernetes object configuration file.

{kube} objects can be configured in a YAML file that contains a description of all your 
deployments, services, or any other objects that you want to deploy. All objects can 
also be deleted from the cluster by using the same YAML file that you used to deploy them.
The [hotspot]`kubernetes.yaml` object configuration file is provided for you. If you are interested 
in learning more about using and configuring Kubernetes clusters, check out the 
https://openliberty.io/guides/kubernetes-intro.html[Deploying microservices to Kubernetes^]
guide.

kubernetes.yaml
[source, yaml, linenums, role="code_column"]
----
include::finish/kubernetes.yaml[]
----

[role="code_command hotspot", subs="quotes"]
----
#Update the `kubernetes.yaml` file.#
`kubernetes.yaml`
----

[role="edit_command_text"]
The [hotspot=systemImage hotspot=inventoryImage]`image` is the name and tag of the container image that you want 
to use for the container. The image address is the OCR address that you logged in to. Update the system 
[hotspot=systemImage]`image` and the inventory [hotspot=inventoryImage]`image` fields to include your project name.

Run the following commands to deploy the objects as defined in kubernetes.yaml file:
[role='command']
```
oc apply -f kubernetes.yaml
```

You see an output similar to the following example:

[role="no_copy"]
----
deployment.apps/system-deployment created
deployment.apps/inventory-deployment created
service/system-service created
service/inventory-service created
route.route.openshift.io/system-route created
route.route.openshift.io/inventory-route created
----

When the apps are deployed, run the following command to check the status of your pods:
[role='command']
```
oc get pods
```

If all the pods are healthy and running, you see an output similar to the following example:
[source, role="no_copy"]
----
NAME                                    READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
system-deployment-6bd97d9bf6-4ccds      1/1       Running   0          15s
inventory-deployment-645767664f-nbtd9   1/1       Running   0          15s
----

// =================================================================================================
// Making requests to the microservices
// =================================================================================================

== Making requests to the microservices

To access the services and the application, use a route. A route in OpenShift exposes a service at 
a hostname such as `www.your-web-app.com` so external users can access the application. 

kubernetes.yaml
[source, yaml, linenums, role="code_column"]
----
include::finish/kubernetes.yaml[]
----

Both the [hotspot=systemRoute]`system` and [hotspot=inventoryRoute]`inventory` routes are configured in the [hotspot]`kubernetes.yaml` 
file, and running the `oc apply -f kubernetes.yaml` command exposed both services.

Your microservices can now be accessed through the hostnames that you can find by running the following command:

[role='command']
```
oc get routes
```

They can also be found in the web console by following the `Networking > Routes > Location` path. 
Hostnames are in the `inventory-route-[project-name].apps.[region].starter.openshift-online.com` format. Ensure that
you are in your project, not the `default` project, which is shown in the upper-left corner of the web console.

To access your microservices, point your browser to the following URLs. Substitute the appropriate hostnames
for the `system` and `inventory` services:

- `http://[system-hostname]/system/properties/`
- `http://[inventory-hostname]/inventory/systems`

In the first URL, you see a result in JSON format with the system properties of the container JVM. The second URL returns an empty list, 
which is expected because no system properties are stored in the inventory yet.

Point your browser to the `http://[inventory-hostname]/inventory/systems/[system-hostname]` URL. When you to go this URL, the system
properties that are taken from the `system` service are automatically stored in the inventory. Revisit the 
`http://[inventory-hostname]/inventory/systems` URL and you see a new entry.

// =================================================================================================
// Testing the microservices
// =================================================================================================

== Testing the microservices

pom.xml
[source, xml, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/inventory/pom.xml[]
----

A few tests are included for you to test the basic functions of the microservices. 
If a test failure occurs, then you might have introduced a bug into the code. 
To run the tests, wait for all pods to be in the ready state before you proceed further. 
The default properties that are defined in the [hotspot]`pom.xml` file are:

[cols="15, 100", options="header"]
|===
| *Property*                                            | *Description*
| [hotspot=systemIP]`system.ip`                         | IP or hostname of the `system-service` {kube} Service
| [hotspot=inventoryIP]`inventory.ip`                   | IP or hostname of the `inventory-service` {kube} Service
|===

Use the following command to run the integration tests against your cluster. 

[role=command]
```
mvn verify \
-Dsystem.ip=$(oc get route system-route -o=jsonpath='{.spec.host}')  \
-Dinventory.ip=$(oc get route inventory-route -o=jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
```

The `system.ip` and `inventory.ip` parameters are replaced with the appropriate hostnames to access the respective microservices.

If the tests pass, you see an output for each service similar to the following example:

== Tearing down the environment

When you no longer need your deployed microservices, you can delete the {kube} deployments, services, and routes 
by running the following command:

[role='command']
```
oc delete -f kubernetes.yaml
```

To delete the pushed images, run the following commands:

[role='command']
```
oc delete imagestream/inventory
oc delete imagestream/system
```

Finally, you can delete the project by running the following command:

[role='command']
```
oc delete project [project-name]
```

// =================================================================================================
// finish
// =================================================================================================

== Great work! You're done!

You just deployed two microservices running in Open Liberty to OpenShift. You also 
learned how to use `oc` to deploy your microservices on a {kube} cluster.
