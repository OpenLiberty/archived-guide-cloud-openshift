// =================================================================================================
// Introduction
// =================================================================================================

== What you'll learn 

You will learn how to deploy two microservices in Open Liberty containers to an OpenShift 3 cluster.
To learn how to deploy to an OpenShift 4 cluster,
see the https://openliberty.io/guides/cloud-openshift-operator.html[Deploying microservices to OpenShift by using Kubernetes Operators^] guide. 

There are different cloud-based solutions for running your {kube} workloads. 
With a cloud-based infrastructure, you can focus on developing your microservices without worrying about low-level infrastructure details for deployment. 
Using a cloud helps you to easily scale and manage your microservices in a high-availability setup.

{kube} is an open source container orchestrator that automates many tasks that are involved in deploying,
managing, and scaling containerized applications. 
If you would like to learn more about Kubernetes,
check out the https://openliberty.io/guides/kubernetes-intro.html[Deploying microservices to Kubernetes^] guide.

OpenShift is a Kubernetes-based platform with added functions.
It streamlines the DevOps process by providing an intuitive development pipeline. 
It also provides integration with multiple tools to make the deployment and management of cloud applications easier.
To learn more about the different platforms that Red Hat OpenShift offers,
check out their https://docs.openshift.com[official documentation^]. 

The two microservices you will deploy are called `system` and `inventory`. 
The `system` microservice returns the JVM system properties of the running container. 
It also returns the podâ€™s name in the HTTP header, making replicas easy to distinguish 
from each other. The `inventory` microservice adds the properties from the `system` microservice 
to the inventory. This process demonstrates how communication can be established between pods inside a cluster.

// =================================================================================================
// Prerequisites
// =================================================================================================

== Additional prerequisites

Before you begin, the following additional tools need to be installed:

* *Docker:* You need a containerization software for building containers. 
Kubernetes supports various container types, but you will use Docker in this guide. 
For installation instructions, refer to the official https://docs.docker.com/install/[Docker documentation^].

* *OpenShift account:* To access a {kube} cluster, you must sign up for a Red Hat OpenShift Online account.
There are two options, Starter and Pro. 
Use the Starter plan, which includes a free trial of the OpenShift platform with limited resources,
making it perfect for individual experimentation. 
The Pro plan includes more resources and has a monthly fee. 
To sign up, go to the https://manage.openshift.com/register/plan[official website^]. 
Keep in mind that the creation time depends on resource availability and might take some time.

* *OpenShift CLI:* You need the OpenShift command-line tool `oc` to interact with your {kube} cluster.
For installation instructions, refer to the official 
https://docs.openshift.com/online/starter/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html[OpenShift Online documentation^].

To verify that the OpenShift CLI is installed correctly, run the following command:

[role=command]
```
oc version
```

The output will be similar to:

[role="no_copy"]
----
oc v3.11.0+0cbc58b
----

// =================================================================================================
// Accessing an OpenShift cluster
// =================================================================================================

== Accessing an OpenShift cluster

Before you can deploy your microservices, you must gain access to a cluster on OpenShift.

Creating an OpenShift account automatically grants you access to their multi-tenant, OpenShift cluster. 
After you have access, you are also given access to their online web console. To login to OpenShift by using the CLI, 
navigate to the online web console by following the `[username] > Copy Login Command > Display Token > Log in with this token` path.

The command looks like the following example:

[role="no_copy"]
----
oc login --token=[your-token] --server=https://api.[region].online-starter.openshift.com:[port]
----

Create a project by running the following command:

[role=command]
```
oc new-project [project-name]
```

== Deploying microservices to OpenShift

In this section, you will learn how to deploy two microservices in Open Liberty containers to a {kube}
cluster on OpenShift. You will build and containerize the `system` and `inventory` microservices, 
push them to a container registry, and then deploy them to your {kube} cluster. 

// =================================================================================================
// Building and containerizing the microservices
// =================================================================================================

=== Building and containerizing the microservices

The first step of deploying to {kube} is to build your microservices and containerize them.

The starting Java project, which is located in the start directory, is a multi-module Maven project. 
It is made up of the `system` and `inventory` microservices. Each microservice resides in its own directory,
`start/system` or `start/inventory`. Both of these directories contain a Dockerfile, which is necessary
for building the Docker images. See the https://openliberty.io/guides/containerize.html[Containerizing microservices^] 
guide if you're unfamiliar with Dockerfiles.

If you're familiar with Maven and Docker, you might be tempted to run a Maven build first and then
use the `.war` file to build a Docker image. The projects are set up so that this process is automated 
as a part of a single Maven build.

Navigate to the `start` directory and build these microservices by running the following commands:

[role=command]
```
cd start
mvn package
```

include::{common-includes}/ol-full-docker-pull.adoc[]

Next, run the `docker build` commands to build container images for your application:
[role='command']
```
docker build -t system:1.0-SNAPSHOT system/.
docker build -t inventory:1.0-SNAPSHOT inventory/.
```

The `-t` flag in the `docker build` command allows the Docker image to be labeled (tagged) in the `name[:tag]` format. 
The tag for an image describes the specific image version.
If the optional `[:tag]` tag is not specified, the `latest` tag is created by default.

During the build, you see various Docker messages that describe what images are being downloaded and
built. When the build finishes, run the following command to list all local Docker images:

[role=command]
```
docker images
```

Verify that the `system:1.0-SNAPSHOT` and `inventory:1.0-SNAPSHOT` images are listed among them, for example:

[role="no_copy"]
----
REPOSITORY                    TAG
system                        1.0-SNAPSHOT
inventory                     1.0-SNAPSHOT
openliberty/open-liberty      full-java11-openj9-ubi
----

If you don't see the `system:1.0-SNAPSHOT` and `inventory:1.0-SNAPSHOT` images, check the Maven
build log for any potential errors.

// =================================================================================================
// Pushing the images to OpenShift's internal registry
// =================================================================================================

=== Pushing the images to OpenShift's internal registry

In order to run the microservices on the cluster,
you need to push the microservice images into a container image registry. 
You will use OpenShift's integrated container image registry called OpenShift Container Registry (OCR). 
After your images are pushed into the registry, you can use them in the pods you create later in the guide.

First, you must authenticate your Docker client to your OCR. Start by running the login command:

[role=command]
```
oc registry login
```

You can store your Docker credentials in a custom external credential store,
which is more secure than using a Docker configuration file. 
If you are using a custom credential store for securing your registry credentials,
or if you are unsure where your credentials are stored, use the following command:

include::{common-includes}/os-tabs.adoc[]

[.tab_content.mac_section.linux_section]
--
[role=command]
```
echo $(oc whoami -t) | docker login -u developer --password-stdin $(oc registry info)
```
--

[.tab_content.windows_section]
--
Because the Windows command prompt doesnâ€™t support the command substitution that is displayed for Mac and Linux,
run the following commands: 
[role=command]
```
oc whoami
oc whoami -t
oc registry info
```

Replace the square brackets in the following `docker login` command with the results from the previous commands:
[role=command]
```
docker login -u [oc whoami] -p [oc whoami -t] [oc registry info]
```
--

The command authenticates your credentials against the internal registry so that you are able to push and pull images. 
The registry address will be displayed after you run the `oc registry login` command.
It is formatted similar to the following output:
[role="no_copy"]
----
default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps.[region].starter.openshift-online.com
----

You can also view the registry address by running the following command:
[role=command]
```
oc registry info
```

Ensure that you are logged in to OpenShift and the registry, and run the following commands to tag your applications:

include::{common-includes}/os-tabs.adoc[]

[.tab_content.mac_section.linux_section]
--
[role=command]
```
docker tag system:1.0-SNAPSHOT $(oc registry info)/$(oc project -q)/system:1.0-SNAPSHOT
docker tag inventory:1.0-SNAPSHOT $(oc registry info)/$(oc project -q)/inventory:1.0-SNAPSHOT
```
--

[.tab_content.windows_section]
--
Run the following commands:   
[role=command]
```
oc registry info
oc project -q
```

Replace the square brackets in the following `docker tag` commands with the results from the previous commands:
[role=command]
```
docker tag system:1.0-SNAPSHOT [oc registry info]/[oc project -q]/system:1.0-SNAPSHOT
docker tag inventory:1.0-SNAPSHOT [oc registry info]/[oc project -q]/inventory:1.0-SNAPSHOT
```
--

Finally, push your images to the registry:

include::{common-includes}/os-tabs.adoc[]

[.tab_content.mac_section.linux_section]
--
[role=command]
```
docker push $(oc registry info)/$(oc project -q)/system:1.0-SNAPSHOT
docker push $(oc registry info)/$(oc project -q)/inventory:1.0-SNAPSHOT
```
--

[.tab_content.windows_section]
--
Run the following commands:
[role=command]
```
oc registry info
oc project -q
```

Replace the square brackets in the following `docker push` commands with the results from the previous commands:
[role=command]
```
docker push [oc registry info]/[oc project -q]/system:1.0-SNAPSHOT
docker push [oc registry info]/[oc project -q]/inventory:1.0-SNAPSHOT
```
--

After you push the images, run the following command to list the images that you pushed to the internal OCR:
[role=command]
```
oc get imagestream
```

Verify that the `system` and `inventory` images are listed among them, for example:
[role="no_copy"]
----
NAME        IMAGE REPOSITORY                                                                                     TAGS           UPDATED

----

// =================================================================================================
// Deploying the microservices
// =================================================================================================

=== Deploying the microservices

Now that your container images are built, deploy them by using a Kubernetes object configuration file.

{kube} objects can be configured in a YAML file that contains a description of all your 
deployments, services, or any other objects that you want to deploy. All objects can 
also be deleted from the cluster by using the same YAML file that you used to deploy them.
The [hotspot]`kubernetes.yaml` object configuration file is provided for you. If you are interested 
in learning more about using and configuring Kubernetes clusters, check out the 
https://openliberty.io/guides/kubernetes-intro.html[Deploying microservices to Kubernetes^]
guide.

kubernetes.yaml
[source, yaml, linenums, role="code_column"]
----
include::finish/kubernetes.yaml[]
----

[role="code_command hotspot", subs="quotes"]
----
#Update the `kubernetes.yaml` file.#
`kubernetes.yaml`
----

[role="edit_command_text"]
The [hotspot=systemImage hotspot=inventoryImage]`image` is the name and tag of the container image that you want 
to use for the container. The image address is the OCR address that you logged in to. Update the system 
[hotspot=systemImage]`image` and the inventory [hotspot=inventoryImage]`image` fields to include your project name.

Run the following commands to deploy the objects as defined in kubernetes.yaml file:
[role='command']
```
oc apply -f kubernetes.yaml
```

You see an output similar to the following example:

[role="no_copy"]
----
deployment.apps/system-deployment created
deployment.apps/inventory-deployment created
service/system-service created
service/inventory-service created
route.route.openshift.io/system-route created
route.route.openshift.io/inventory-route created
----

When the apps are deployed, run the following command to check the status of your pods:
[role='command']
```
oc get pods
```

If all the pods are healthy and running, you see an output similar to the following example:
[source, role="no_copy"]
----
NAME                                    READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
system-deployment-6bd97d9bf6-4ccds      1/1       Running   0          15s
inventory-deployment-645767664f-nbtd9   1/1       Running   0          15s
----

// =================================================================================================
// Making requests to the microservices
// =================================================================================================

== Making requests to the microservices

To access the services and the application, use a route. A route in OpenShift exposes a service at 
a hostname such as `www.your-web-app.com` so external users can access the application. 

kubernetes.yaml
[source, yaml, linenums, role="code_column"]
----
include::finish/kubernetes.yaml[]
----

Both the [hotspot=systemRoute]`system` and [hotspot=inventoryRoute]`inventory` routes are configured in the [hotspot]`kubernetes.yaml` 
file, and running the `oc apply -f kubernetes.yaml` command exposed both services.

Your microservices can now be accessed through the hostnames that you can find by running the following command:

[role='command']
```
oc get routes
```

They can also be found in the web console by following the `Networking > Routes > Location` path. 
Hostnames are in the `inventory-route-[project-name].apps.[region].starter.openshift-online.com` format. Ensure that
you are in your project, not the `default` project, which is shown in the upper-left corner of the web console.

To access your microservices, point your browser to the following URLs. Substitute the appropriate hostnames
for the `system` and `inventory` services:

* `http://[system-hostname]/system/properties/`
* `http://[inventory-hostname]/inventory/systems`

In the first URL, you see a result in JSON format with the system properties of the container JVM.
The second URL returns an empty list, which is expected because no system properties are stored in the inventory yet.

Point your browser to the `http://[inventory-hostname]/inventory/systems/[system-hostname]` URL.
When you to go this URL, the system properties that are taken from the `system`
service are automatically stored in the inventory.
Revisit the `http://[inventory-hostname]/inventory/systems` URL and you see a new entry.

// =================================================================================================
// Testing the microservices
// =================================================================================================

== Testing the microservices

pom.xml
[source, xml, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/inventory/pom.xml[]
----

A few tests are included for you to test the basic functions of the microservices. 
If a test failure occurs, then you might have introduced a bug into the code. 
To run the tests, wait for all pods to be in the ready state before you proceed further. 
The default properties that are defined in the [hotspot]`pom.xml` file are:

[cols="15, 100", options="header"]
|===
| *Property*                                            | *Description*
| [hotspot=systemIP]`system.ip`                         | IP or hostname of the `system-service` {kube} Service
| [hotspot=inventoryIP]`inventory.ip`                   | IP or hostname of the `inventory-service` {kube} Service
|===

Use the following command to run the integration tests against your cluster. Substitute 
`[region]` and `[project-name]` with the appropriate values:

[role=command]
```
mvn verify \
-Dsystem.ip=system-route-[project-name].apps.[region].starter.openshift-online.com  \
-Dinventory.ip=inventory-route-[project-name].apps.[region].starter.openshift-online.com
```

* The `system.ip` parameter is replaced with the appropriate hostname to access your system microservice.
* The `inventory.ip` parameter is replaced with the appropriate hostname to access your inventory microservice.

If the tests pass, you see an output for each service similar to the following example:

== Tearing down the environment

When you no longer need your deployed microservices, you can delete the {kube} deployments, services, and routes 
by running the following command:

[role='command']
```
oc delete -f kubernetes.yaml
```

To delete the pushed images, run the following commands:

[role='command']
```
oc delete imagestream/inventory
oc delete imagestream/system
```

Finally, you can delete the project by running the following command:

[role='command']
```
oc delete project [project-name]
```

// =================================================================================================
// finish
// =================================================================================================

== Great work! You're done!

You just deployed two microservices running in Open Liberty to OpenShift. You also 
learned how to use `oc` to deploy your microservices on a {kube} cluster.
